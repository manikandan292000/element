     <h1 style="text-align:center;color:red;">THE FARMER</h1>
	   <p>A <b>farmer</b> is a<strong> person</strong> engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials.<br>
	     [1] The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock.<br>
	      A <b>farmer</b> <del>might own the farmland or might work as a laborer on land owned by others.</del><br> In most developed economies, a <b>"farmer"</b> 
	      is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers (or farmhands).<br>
	      However, in other older definitions a <b>farmer</b> was a<strong> person</strong> who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land, 
	      or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention.

     <h1 style="color:blue;">History</h1>
	   <p>Farming dates back as far as the Neolithic, being one of the defining characteristics of that era.<mark> By the Bronze Age,<br>
	      the Sumerians had an agriculture specialized labor force by 5000–4000 BCE,</mark> and heavily depended on irrigation to grow crops.<br>
	      They relied on three-person teams when harvesting in the spring.[5] The Ancient Egypt farmers farmed and relied and irrigated <br>
	      their water from the Nile.[6]

          Animal husbandry, the practice of rearing animals specifically for farming purposes, has existed for thousands of years.<br>
          Dogs were domesticated in East Asia about 15,000 years ago.<i> Goats and sheep were domesticated around 8000 BCE in Asia.</i><br>
          <em>Swine or pigs were domesticated by 7000 BCE in the Middle East and China.</em><br>
		  The earliest evidence of horse domestication dates to around 4000 BCE.[7]

	 <h1 style="color:blue;">Advancements in technology</h1>
	   <p> <u>the US of the 1930s,</u> <del>one farmer could produce only enough food to feed three other consumers.</del> <br>
		  A modern farmer produces enough food to feed well over a hundred people. However, some authors consider 
		  this estimate to be flawed,<br>
		  as it does not take into account that farming requires energy and many other resources which have to be provided by <ins>manikandan</ins> madditional workers,<br>
		  so that the ratio of<u> people fed to farmers is actually smaller than 100 to 1.[8]</u>

     <h1 style="color:blue;">Techniques</h1>
	   <p>In the context of developing nations or other pre-industrial cultures, most farmers practice a meager subsistence agriculture—a 
          simple organic-farming system employing crop rotation, seed saving, slash and burn,
          or other techniques to maximize efficiency while meeting the needs of the household or community. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"target="_blank">www.farmer.com</a><br>
          One subsisting in this way may become labelled as a peasant, often associated disparagingly with a "peasant mentality".[10]
          In developed nations, however, a person using such techniques <q>on small patches of land might be called a gardener and be considered a hobbyist.</q>
          Alternatively, <s>one might be driven into such practices by poverty or, ironically—against</s> <br>
          the background of large-scale<sub> agribusiness—might</sub> become an organic <sup>farmer </sup>growing for discerning/faddish consumers in the local food market.
